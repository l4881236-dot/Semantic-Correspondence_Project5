# Semantic Correspondence with Visual Foundation Models

This repository contains the official implementation for the course project **"Semantic Correspondence with Visual Foundation Models"**.

We explore the capabilities of Foundation Models (DINOv2, SAM, Stable Diffusion) on the semantic correspondence task and propose a **Light Fine-tuning** strategy that significantly improves performance on the **SPair-71k** benchmark.
